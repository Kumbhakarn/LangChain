# LangChain_Ecosystem_Complete

A comprehensive collection of examples and components from the LangChain ecosystem — including Chains, Prompts, Tools, Models, Vector Stores, Runnables, Output Parsers, and Retrievers — to help developers build and prototype powerful LLM-based applications.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔗 **Chains** – Build modular and reusable pipelines for LLMs
- 🧠 **Prompts** – Custom prompt templates and dynamic generation
- 🛠️ **Tools** – Integrate external tools and APIs with LLMs
- 🤖 **Models** – Interface with various LLM providers (OpenAI, HuggingFace, etc.)
- 🗂️ **Vector Stores** – Store and retrieve embeddings efficiently
- 🔁 **Runnables** – Flexible composable execution of LangChain logic
- 📤 **Output Parsers** – Convert raw LLM output into structured data
- 🔍 **Retrievers** – Fetch relevant context for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

## ▶️ Usage

Explore each module directory for example scripts and notebooks. You can run most examples with:

```bash
python chains/example_chain.py
```

Make sure to set your API keys (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere) as environment variables or in a `.env` file.
